This is only documentation.
Implementation is in [HS-EsoVM](https://esovm.github.io/hs-esovm/)

## EsoLangs
List of supported esoteric languages:
   * [BrainFuck](https://esolangs.org/wiki/Brainfuck)
   * [SubLeq](http://mazonka.com/subleq/) and [SLAsm](http://mazonka.com/subleq/sqasm.cpp)
   * [W Assembler]
   * [ETA](http://www.miketaylor.org.uk/tech/eta/doc/manual.html) and [EAS](http://www.miketaylor.org.uk/tech/eta/doc/easman.html)
   * [Piet](https://www.dangermouse.net/esoteric/piet.html)
   * [BeFunge](https://web.archive.org/web/20010417044912/http://cantor.res.cmu.edu/bozeman/befunge/beffaq.html)
   * [WhiteSpace] and [WSA](http://web.archive.org/web/20150102035404/http://www.burghard.info/Code/Whitespace/index.html)

## EsoAsm
* **Assembly languages** are *second-generation programming languages*
* **EsoAsm** is *loosely static typed* common programming language and abstraction over all *esoteric languages*

## EsoC
* **C language** is one of *high-level* *third-generation programming languages*
* **EsoC** is *weakly static typed* *high-level* **C language**, which is compiled to **EsoAsm**

## EsoDSL
* **DSL** means *domain-specific languages*. Some **DSL** are *fourth-generation programming languages*
* **EsoDSL** is *stringly typed **DSL** like TCL for writing libraries for **EsoC**

**EsoDSL** has many iconicities, but every one iconicity is homoiconicity:
* **S-expressions** like Racket/Scheme for computers
* **M-expressions** like TCL for humans
* **W-expressions** like YAML for reports
